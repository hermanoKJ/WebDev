        <h2>Step 1</h2>
        <p><br>A month ago, as instructed by my lecturer, I started using freecodecamp to learn responsive web development.
            Though it wasn't my first time learning web development, using freecodecamp gave me the practical experience I sought.
            The lessons were divided into 18 different modules. The first course was focused on introducing me, the student to HTML.
            The next two courses introduced CSS. It tasked me to build some basic designs using css.
            The first of the two was meant to introduce me to the basic HTML styling with CSS.
            The second of both then introduced me to CSS colours. It taught me the effect of CSS colouring, and how CSS colours work.
            The third of the 18 courses, then introduced me to basic form creation. This also introduced me to basic html formatting with CSS.
            After this, there was a project i had to complete. In said freecodecamp projects, the students aren't guided to create the projects, but rather given certain guidelines to complete.
            I was given a webpage, and was tasked to develop something that is functionally similar to the webpage given. It was a nice learning experience, as i did my best to copy the webpage as much as posssible.
