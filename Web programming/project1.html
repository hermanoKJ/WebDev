<h1 style="text-align: center;">My Experience With Freecodecamp</h1>
    
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-family: serif,garamond;">I'm Kojo Herbert<br>And this is my web dev journey</p>
      
    
   
   <p>My experience with freecodecamp has been intriguing and amazing. Being able to create a webpage has showed that if i commit to this and market myself properly, it can serve as a finacial breakthrough .
    Using freecodecamp html and css has made me venture into the broad concepts of web dev. Where i have found myself watching multiple videos and made intense research, so i can gasp the syntax of the programming. 
    During the course of the week. I went further into html, where i studied the html form and their attributes
    Being able to host a web page was also new to me.<br>The try and errors were quite annoying but i never back out from a challenge.
    For the hosting my colleague assisted me with it. But i tried it myself later that day and it wasn't anything that challengling </p>
